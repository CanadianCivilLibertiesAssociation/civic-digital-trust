# Aspirations for a Civic Digital Trust

Aspirations are statements about what we hope to achieve with a civic data trust. A clear and shared purpose helps focus and prioritize what data collection to allow for which public benefits.  

Based on a literature review, we provided participants in the civic digital trust workshop with a draft list of aspiration. Participants added to the list and then voted on the aspirations they thought were most important for the City of Toronto. The top four aspirations identified by workshop participants were to:

1. Bring forward the voices of marginalized groups \(inclusivity, justice and equity\)
2. Promote local and Canadian economic development
3. Strengthen democratic governance and institutions
4. Create a strong community of engagement and empowerment

Other principles that were considered by workshop participants, but not ranked as most important, included:

* Improve quality of life for residents and visitors
* Ensure access and equity of public services 
* Improve affordability of urban life
* Enhance public safety 
* Reduce the environmental footprint of urban settlements
